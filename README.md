**Project Title: Predicting Heart Disease Risk from Health Camp Data**
•	Domain: Healthcare, Public Health
•	Technologies: Python, Jupyter Notebook
•	Objective: Developing a predictive model to find out the likelihood of heart disease in a real-world dataset of 2,250 individuals collected from 8 health camp sites across West Bengal. This project aimed to establish a baseline for early risk identification within a diverse population.
•	Methodology: 
o	Conducted comprehensive data cleaning and exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand data distributions and identify potential issues.
o	Assessed the predictive power of various physiological features using statistical tests (t-test, ANOVA) for model development.
o	Implemented and evaluated linear regression models (Ordinary Least Squares - OLS, Partial Least Squares - PLS) to establish a robust predictive baseline.
•	Key Achievement: Successfully developed a baseline predictive model achieving an adjusted R² score of 0.102 on unseen test data. This result significantly outperformed previous research on physiological data (e.g., R² of 0.05 on a Korean population as cited in Nature, 2018), demonstrating the model's effectiveness in capturing complex relationships within real-world health data.



**Project Title: Time-Series Forecasting of Potato Prices, Agmarknet & Rainfall Integration**
•	Domain: Quantitative Finance, Agricultural Economics
•	Technologies: Python, Jupyter Notebook, Scikit-learn, TensorFlow/Keras (implied by LSTM)
•	Objective: To develop and validate a time-series forecasting model for potato prices in selected Hooghly district markets, West Bengal. The model leverages 15 years of historical Agmarknet price and corresponding rainfall data to provide granular (monthly/weekly) price predictions for at least one financial year ahead.
•	Methodology: 
o	Conducted thorough data engineering, including cleaning, aggregation, and feature extraction from disparate weekly/daily Agmarknet and rainfall datasets.
o	Performed extensive exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand seasonal patterns, trends, and correlations critical for good quality time-series modeling.
o	Applied and optimized a range of supervised learning algorithms, including tree-based models (Random Forest Regressor), instance-based learning (KNN), and advanced recurrent neural networks (LSTM), for baseline prediction.
•	Key Achievement: The final predictive model demonstrated exceptional performance, achieving an adjusted R² score of 0.93 on independent test data. This high accuracy signifies the model's efficacy in forecasting complex agricultural commodity prices. This model offers significant potential for proactive market planning and can be adapted for forecasting other similar agricultural commodities.
