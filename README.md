**Project Title: Time-Series Forecasting of Potato Prices, Agmarknet & Rainfall Integration**

•	Objective: To develop and validate a time-series forecasting model for potato prices in selected Hooghly district markets, West Bengal. The model leverages 15 years of historical Agmarknet price and corresponding rainfall data to provide granular (monthly/weekly) price predictions for at least one financial year ahead.
•	Methodology: 
o	Conducted thorough data engineering, including cleaning, aggregation, and feature extraction from disparate weekly/daily Agmarknet and rainfall datasets.
o	Performed extensive exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand seasonal patterns, trends, and correlations critical for good quality time-series modeling.
o	Applied and optimized a range of supervised learning algorithms, including tree-based models (Random Forest Regressor), instance-based learning (KNN), and advanced recurrent neural networks (LSTM), for baseline prediction.
•	Key Achievement: The final predictive model demonstrated exceptional performance, achieving an adjusted R² score of 0.93 on independent test data. This high accuracy signifies the model's efficacy in forecasting complex agricultural commodity prices. This model offers significant potential for proactive market planning and can be adapted for forecasting other similar agricultural commodities.
